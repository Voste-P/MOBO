# RBAC Matrix (As Implemented)

This is the _current_ authorization view derived from route guards + controller ownership checks. It is meant to be used as a working document for tightening/standardizing RBAC.

Base URL: `/api`

## Roles

- `admin`: global privileged
- `ops`: global privileged (treated as admin-equivalent by `isPrivileged`)
- `brand`: brand portal user
- `agency`: agency portal user
- `mediator`: mediator portal user
- `shopper`: buyer user

Notes:

- Most routes rely on `requireAuth(env)` (JWT + DB reload) and `requireRoles(...)` for coarse gating.
- Fine-grained scoping is often in controllers (e.g., “only your network”).

## Matrix (high level)

Legend:

- ✅ = allowed
- ❌ = not allowed
- ⚠️ = allowed but scoped (ownership/network)

\* AI routes are generally `optionalAuth` (some endpoints are `admin|ops` only).

## Scope rules (important)

### Orders

- `GET /orders/user/:userId`
  - shopper: only self
  - admin/ops: any user

- `POST /orders`
  - shopper only; cannot create orders for another user
  - campaign must be accessible to buyer lineage (agency allow-list OR mediator assignment)

- `POST /ops/verify`
  - admin/ops always allowed
  - mediator/agency allowed but scoped to their network
  - mediator self-verification for their own buyers is blocked

- `POST /ops/orders/settle`
  - admin/ops only
  - now debits brand wallet for payout before crediting buyer+mediator

### Tickets

- shopper: own tickets only
- brand/agency/mediator: tickets referencing orders within their scope OR their own tickets
- admin/ops: all tickets

### Brand connections

- `POST /ops/brands/connect`: agency-only intent; creates brand pending connection
- `POST /brand/requests/resolve`: brand/admin/ops; approves/rejects

## Follow-ups (next tightening)

- Standardize all “scoped list” endpoints to use shared helper(s) so scoping is consistent and testable.
- Add explicit policy tests for each role against key endpoints (403 vs 200) and for ownership violations.
